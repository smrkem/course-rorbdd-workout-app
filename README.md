# Ruby on Rails 5, BDD, Rspec and Capybara | Udemy  
This repo is the project for the second part of the udemy course:  
https://www.udemy.com/ruby-rails-5-bdd-rspec-capybara/  

as before I will be using docker, and also doing my best to include at least model tests in addition to the feature specs in the course.  

It is my hope that this part of the course will actually touch on testing the real-time features in the project.
